chemical\r\ncomposition, and kinematic properties. intermediate-age and old open clusters\r\nare less common, and it is even harder to find them inside the solar\r\ngalactocentric radius, due to the high mortality rate and strong extinction\r\ninside this region. ngc 6802 is one of the inner disk open clusters (iocs)\r\nobserved by the $gaia$-eso survey (ges). this cluster is an important target\r\nfor calibrating the abundances derived in the survey due to the kinematic and\r\nchemical homogeneity of the members in open clusters. using the measurements\r\nfrom $gaia$-eso internal data release 4 (idr4), we identify 95 main-sequence\r\ndwarfs as cluster members from the giraffe target list, and eight giants as\r\ncluster members from the uves target list. the dwarf cluster members have a\r\nmedian radial velocity of $13.6\\pm1.9$ km s$^{-1}$, while the giant cluster\r\nmembers have a median radial velocity of $12.0\\pm0.9$ km s$^{-1}$ and a median\r\n[fe/h] of $0.10\\pm0.02$ dex. the color-magnitude diagram of these cluster\r\nmembers suggests an age of $0.9\\pm0.1$ gyr, with $(m-m)_0=11.4$ and\r\n$e(b-v)=0.86$. we perform the first detailed chemical abundance analysis of ngc\r\n6802, including 27 elemental species. to gain a more general picture about\r\niocs, the measurements of ngc 6802 are compared with those of other iocs\r\npreviously studied by ges, that is, ngc 4815, trumpler 20, ngc 6705, and\r\nberkeley 81. ngc 6802 shows similar c, n, na, and al abundances as other iocs.\r\nthese elements are compared with nucleosynthetic models as a function of\r\ncluster turn-off mass. the $\\alpha$, iron-peak, and neutron-capture elements\r\nare also explored in a self-consistent way.\r\n", "  cross technology interference (cti) is a prevalent phenomenon in the 2.4 ghz\r\nunlicensed spectrum causing packet losses and increased channel contention. in\r\nparticular, wifi interference is a severe problem for low-power wireless\r\nnetworks as its presence causes a significant degradation of the overall\r\nperformance. in this paper, we propose a proactive approach based on wifi\r\ninterference modeling for accurately predicting transmission opportunities for\r\nlow-power wireless networks. we leverage statistical analysis of real-world\r\nwifi traces to learn aggregated traffic characteristics in terms of\r\ninter-arrival time (iat) that, once captured into a specific 2nd order markov\r\nmodulated poisson process (mmpp(2)) model, enable accurate estimation of\r\ninterference. we further use a hidden markov model (hmm) for channel occupancy\r\nprediction. we evaluated the performance of i) the mmpp(2) traffic model w.r.t.\r\nreal-world traces and an existing pareto model for accurately characterizing\r\nthe wifi traffic and, ii) compared the hmm based white space prediction to\r\nrandom channel access. we report encouraging results for using interference\r\nmodeling for white space prediction.\r\n", "  recent investigations have shown that the extended main-sequence turnoffs\r\n(emstos) are a common feature of intermediate-age star clusters in the\r\nmagellanic clouds. the emstos are also found in the color-magnitude diagram\r\n(cmd) of young-age star clusters. the origin of the emstos is still an open\r\nquestion. moreover, asteroseismology shows that the value of the overshooting\r\nparameter $\\delta_{\\rm ov}$ of the convective core is not fixed for the stars\r\nwith an approximatelly equal mass. thus the msto of star clusters may be\r\naffected by the overshooting of the convective core (ovcc). we calculated the\r\neffects of the ovcc with different $\\delta_{\\rm ov}$ on the msto of young- and\r\nintermediate-age star clusters. \\textbf{if $\\delta_{\\rm ov}$ varies between\r\nstars in a cluster,} the observed emstos of young- and intermediate-age star\r\nclusters can be explained well by the effects. the equivalent age spreads of\r\nmsto caused by the ovcc are related to the age of star clusters and are in good\r\nagreement with observed results of many clusters. moreover, the observed emstos\r\nof ngc 1856 are reproduced by the coeval populations with different\r\n$\\delta_{\\rm ov}$. the emstos of star clusters may be relevant to the effects\r\nof the ovcc. the effects of the ovcc \\textbf{are similar to that of rotation in\r\nsome respects. but the effects cannot result in a significant split of main\r\nsequence of young star clusters at $m_{u}\\lesssim 21$.} the presence of a rapid\r\nrotation can make the split of main sequence of young star clusters more\r\nsignificant.\r\n"], "Topic 2": ["  we use the hydrodynamical galaxy formation simulations from the illustris\r\nsuite to study the origin and properties of galaxy velocity bias, i.e., the\r\ndifference between the velocity distributions of galaxies and dark matter\r\ninside halos. we find that galaxy velocity bias is a decreasing function of the\r\nratio of galaxy stellar mass to host halo mass. in general, central galaxies\r\nare not at rest with respect to dark matter halos or the core of halos, with a\r\nvelocity dispersion above 0.04 times that of the dark matter. the central\r\ngalaxy velocity bias is found to be mostly caused by the close interactions\r\nbetween the central and satellite galaxies. for satellite galaxies, the\r\nvelocity bias is related to their dynamical and tidal evolution history after\r\nbeing accreted onto the host halos. it depends on the time after the accretion\r\nand their distances from the halo centers, with massive satellites generally\r\nmoving more slowly than the dark matter. the results are in broad agreements\r\nwith those inferred from modeling small-scale redshift-space galaxy clustering\r\ndata, and the study can help improve models of redshift-space galaxy\r\nclustering.\r\n", "  we consider the sloshing problem for an incompressible, inviscid,\r\nirrotational fluid in an open container, including effects due to surface\r\ntension on the free surface. we restrict ourselves to a constant contact angle\r\nand seek time-harmonic solutions of the linearized problem, which describes the\r\ntime-evolution of the fluid due to a small initial disturbance of the surface\r\nat rest. as opposed to the zero surface tension case, where the problem reduces\r\nto a partial differential equation for the velocity potential, we obtain a\r\ncoupled system for the velocity potential and the free surface displacement. we\r\nderive a new variational formulation of the coupled problem and establish the\r\nexistence of solutions using the direct method from the calculus of variations.\r\nwe prove a domain monotonicity result for the fundamental sloshing eigenvalue.\r\nin the limit of zero surface tension, we recover the variational formulation of\r\nthe mixed steklov-neumann eigenvalue problem and give the first-order\r\nperturbation formula for a simple eigenvalue.\r\n", "  we demonstrate that spin supercurrents are conserved upon transmission\r\nthrough a conventional superconductor, even in the presence of spin-dependent\r\nscattering by impurities with magnetic moments or spin-orbit coupling. this is\r\nfundamentally different from conventional spin currents, which decay in the\r\npresence of such scattering, and this has important implications for the usage\r\nof superconducting materials in spintronic hybrid structures.\r\n"], "Topic 3": ["  meteorites contain minerals from solar system asteroids with different\r\nproperties (like size, presence of water, core formation). we provide new\r\nmid-ir transmission spectra of powdered meteorites to obtain templates of how\r\nmid-ir spectra of asteroidal debris would look like. this is essential for\r\ninterpreting mid-ir spectra of past and future space observatories, like the\r\njames webb space telescope. we show that the transmission spectra of wet and\r\ndry chondrites, carbonaceous and ordinary chondrites and achondrite and\r\nchondrite meteorites are distinctly different in a way one can distinguish in\r\nastronomical mid-ir spectra. the two observables that spectroscopically\r\nseparate the different meteorites groups (and thus the different types of\r\nparent bodies) are the pyroxene-olivine feature strength ratio and the peak\r\nshift of the olivine spectral features due to an increase in the iron\r\nconcentration of the olivine.\r\n", "  frame aggregation is a mechanism by which multiple frames are combined into a\r\nsingle transmission unit over the air. frames aggregated at the amsdu level use\r\na common crc check to enforce integrity. for longer aggregated amsdu frames,\r\nthe packet error rate increases significantly for the same bit error rate.\r\nhence, multiple studies have proposed doing amsdu aggregation adaptively based\r\non the error rate. this study evaluates if there is a \\emph{practical}\r\nadvantage in doing adaptive amsdu aggregation based on the link bit error rate.\r\nevaluations on a model show that instead of implementing a complex adaptive\r\namsdu frame aggregation mechanism which impact queuing and other implementation\r\naspects, it is easier to influence packet error rate with traditional\r\nmechanisms while keeping the amsdu aggregation logic simple.\r\n", "  a central issue in the theory of extreme values focuses on suitable\r\nconditions such that the well-known results for the limiting distributions of\r\nthe maximum of i.i.d. sequences can be applied to stationary ones. in this\r\ncontext, the extremal index appears as a key parameter to capture the effect of\r\ntemporal dependence on the limiting distribution of the maxima. the\r\nmultivariate extremal index corresponds to a generalization of this concept to\r\na multivariate context and affects the tail dependence structure within the\r\nmarginal sequences and between them. as it is a function, the inference becomes\r\nmore difficult, and it is therefore important to obtain characterizations,\r\nnamely bounds based on the marginal dependence that are easier to estimate. in\r\nthis work we present two decompositions that emphasize different types of\r\ninformation contained in the multivariate extremal index, an upper limit better\r\nthan those found in the literature and we analyze its role in dependence on the\r\nlimiting model of the componentwise maxima of a stationary sequence. we will\r\nillustrate the results with examples of recognized interest in applications.\r\n"], "Topic 4": ["  we present novel understandings of the gamma-poisson (gap) model, a\r\nprobabilistic matrix factorization model for count data. we show that gap can\r\nbe rewritten free of the score/activation matrix. this gives us new insights\r\nabout the estimation of the topic/dictionary matrix by maximum marginal\r\nlikelihood estimation. in particular, this explains the robustness of this\r\nestimator to over-specified values of the factorization rank, especially its\r\nability to automatically prune irrelevant dictionary columns, as empirically\r\nobserved in previous work. the marginalization of the activation matrix leads\r\nin turn to a new monte carlo expectation-maximization algorithm with favorable\r\nproperties.\r\n", "  proving that a cryptographic protocol is correct for secrecy is a hard task.\r\none of the strongest strategies to reach this goal is to show that it is\r\nincreasing, which means that the security level of every single atomic message\r\nexchanged in the protocol, safely evaluated, never deceases. recently, two\r\nfamilies of functions have been proposed to measure the security level of\r\natomic messages. the first one is the family of interpretation-functions. the\r\nsecond is the family of witness-functions. in this paper, we show that the\r\nwitness-functions are more efficient than interpretation-functions. we give a\r\ndetailed analysis of an ad-hoc protocol on which the witness-functions succeed\r\nin proving its correctness for secrecy while the interpretation-functions fail\r\nto do so.\r\n", "  this paper proposes a regularized pairwise difference approach for estimating\r\nthe linear component coefficient in a partially linear model, with consistency\r\nand exact rates of convergence obtained in high

and (ii) the procedure could even maintain fast rate of\r\nconvergence for $\\alpha$-h\u00f6lder class of $\\alpha\\leq1/2$. simulation studies\r\nshow the advantage of the proposed method, and
